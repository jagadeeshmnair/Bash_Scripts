Step 1 : Run the script "jenkins_script.sh".

Step 2: Once Jenkins is up, login with the admin password displayed in the window.

step 3: Open another command line and run the script "jenkins_plugins_new.sh"

Note: If you change the admin password from the default password, make changes in the script before proceeding this step.

All plugins will be successfully installed in Jenkins after this.
